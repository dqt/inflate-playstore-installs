Yes it can be done using the AccountManager and the removeAccount method.

First get an instance of the AccountManager:

AccountManager am = AccountManager.get(this);
Then get a list of all accounts on the device:

Account[] accounts = am.getAccounts();
Once you've chosen which account(s) you want to remove (for this example we'll just use the first), call removeAccount on them:

if (accounts.length > 0) {
    Account accountToRemove = accounts[0];
    am.removeAccount(accountToRemove, null, null);
}
You can use the 2nd parameter of the removeAccount method to supply a callback to be called once the account has been removed (removing an account is an asynchronous operation).
